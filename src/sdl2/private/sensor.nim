##  sensor.nim
##  ==========
##
##  Include file for SDL sensor event handling.
##
##   In order to use these functions, ``sdl.init()`` must have been called
##   with the `INIT_SENSOR` flag. This causes SDL to scan the system
##   for sensors, and load appropriate drivers.

type
  Sensor* = pointer

type
  SensorID* = int32 ##  \
    ##  This is a unique ID for a sensor for the time it is connected to the
    ##  system, and is never reused for the lifetime of the application.
    ##
    ##  The ID value starts at `0` and increments from there.
    ##  The value `-1` is an invalid ID.

type
  SensorType* {.size: sizeof(cint).} = enum ##  '
    ##  The different sensors defined by SDL
    ##
    ##  Additional sensors may be available, using platform dependent semantics.
    ##
    ##  Hare are the additional Android sensors:
    ##  https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorEvent.html#values
    SENSOR_INVALID = -1,      ##  Returned for an invalid sensor
    SENSOR_UNKNOWN,           ##  Unknown sensor type
    SENSOR_ACCEL,             ##  Accelerometer
    SENSOR_GYRO               ##  Gyroscope

const
  STANDARD_GRAVITY* = 9.806649999999999

##
##  ``Accelerometer sensor``
##
##  The accelerometer returns the current acceleration in SI meters per
##  second squared. This includes gravity, so a device at rest will have
##  an acceleration of `STANDARD_GRAVITY` straight down.
##
##  values[0]: Acceleration on the x axis
##
##  values[1]: Acceleration on the y axis
##
##  values[2]: Acceleration on the z axis
##
##  For phones held in portrait mode, the axes are defined as follows:
##
##  -X ... +X : left ... right
##
##  -Y ... +Y : bottom ... top
##
##  -Z ... +Z : farther ... closer
##
##  The axis data is not changed when the phone is rotated.
##
##  See also:
##
##  ``getDisplayOrientation()``
##

##
##  ``Gyroscope sensor``
##
##  The gyroscope returns the current rate of rotation in radians per second.
##  The rotation is positive in the counter-clockwise direction. That is,
##  an observer looking from a positive location on one of the axes would
##  see positive rotation on that axis when it appeared to be rotating
##  counter-clockwise.
##
##  values[0]: Angular speed around the x axis
##
##  values[1]: Angular speed around the y axis
##
##  values[2]: Angular speed around the z axis
##
##  For phones held in portrait mode, the axes are defined as follows:
##
##  -X ... +X : left ... right
##
##  -Y ... +Y : bottom ... top
##
##  -Z ... +Z : farther ... closer
##
##  The axis data is not changed when the phone is rotated.
